# Operators

## Optional chaining operator
- ?. accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is undefined or null, it returns undefined instead of throwing an error.

## Nullish coalescing operator
- a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. 

## Spreading operators
- "...": spread operator when used to expand values/properties on an array/object; rest operator when used to merge arguments passed to a function;

## Destructuring
- for objects or arrays
- for objects:
    - name must match with object's property
- for arrays:
    - can name anything we want
